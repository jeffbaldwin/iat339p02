            <p class="large_text_paragraph">
                At Sensitive Pins, we are dedicated to creating pins for sensitive individuals wanting to wear their feelings on their sleeve. Our pins are designed by a selection of artists dedicated to supporting our cause of being open with our sensitive feelings. Fifty percent of proceeds go towards our Sensitive Charity to help individuals with their sensitive needs.
            </p>

            <p class="large_text_paragraph">
                We were founded by Jeffrey and Valerie, a duo that met and bonded through crying over Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind at a local theatre. We are both advocates for honesty with self and owning up to our emotions. Therefore, we started
                the Sensitive Charity in 2005, a non-profit organization with the goal to help educate and foster proper relationships between an individual and their sensitivities. Every month, we host workshops at Mulholland Community Center (Room 2031)
                for emotion counselling, sensitive anonymous, special sensitive topics and yoga therapy (complementary hot herbal tea with honey).
            </p>

            <p class="large_text_paragraph">
                Sensitive Pins, later created in 2010, was a side project we decided to initiate after great success in the number of participants at our workshops. During one of the counselling sessions, a sensitive individual suggested that we wear our
                feelings on the outside. Inspired, we tried designing pins for fun, something small but meaningful. Now we have collaborated with over 20 artists and designers all over the world and hope to continue doing cool things.
